                Fweez Terms of Service<br />
                <br />
                Welcome to Fweez!<br />
                <br />
                1. Your relationship with Fweez<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.1 Your use of Fweez&rsquo;s products, software, services and web sites (referred to
                collectively as the &ldquo;Services&rdquo; in this document and excluding any services provided to you
                by Fweez under a separate written agreement) is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you
                and Fweez. &ldquo;Fweez&rdquo; is under Advanced Online Media Strategies Inc., whose principal place of
                business is at 1979 Marcus Avenue Suite 210 Lake Success, New York 11042 United States.</p>
            <p><br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.2 Unless otherwise agreed in writing with Fweez, your agreement with Fweez will
                always include, at a minimum, the terms and conditions set out in this document. These are referred to
                below as the &ldquo;Universal Terms&rdquo;.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.3 Your agreement with Fweez will also include the terms of any Legal Notices
                applicable to the Services, in addition to the Universal Terms. All of these are referred to below as
                the &ldquo;Additional Terms&rdquo;. Where Additional Terms apply to a Service, these will be accessible
                for you to read either within, or through your use of, that Service.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.4 The Universal Terms, together with the Additional Terms, form a legally binding
                agreement between you and Fweez in relation to your use of the Services. It is important that you take
                the time to read them carefully. Collectively, this legal agreement is referred to below as the
                &ldquo;Terms&rdquo;.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.5 If there is any contradiction between what the Additional Terms say and what the
                Universal Terms say, then the Additional Terms shall take precedence in relation to that Service.<br />
                <br />
                2. Accepting the Terms<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.1 In order to use the Services, you must first agree to the Terms. You may not use
                the Services if you do not accept the Terms.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.2 You can accept the Terms by:<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (A) clicking to accept or agree to the Terms, where this
                option is made available to you by Fweez in the user interface for any Service; or<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (B) by actually using the Services. In this case, you
                understand and agree that Fweez will treat your use of the Services as acceptance of the Terms from that
                point onwards.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.3 You may not use the Services and may not accept the Terms if (a) you are not of
                legal age to form a binding contract with Fweez, or (b) you are a person barred from receiving the
                Services under the laws of the United States or other countries including the country in which you are
                resident or from which you use the Services.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.4 Before you continue, you should print off or save a local copy of the Universal
                Terms for your records.<br />
                <br />
                3. Language of the Terms<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.1 Where Fweez has provided you with a translation of the English language version
                of the Terms, then you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the
                English language versions of the Terms will govern your relationship with Fweez.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.2 If there is any contradiction between what the English language version of the
                Terms says and what a translation says, then the English language version shall take precedence.<br />
                <br />
                4. Provision of the Services by Fweez<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.1 Fweez has subsidiaries and affiliated legal entities around the world
                (&ldquo;Subsidiaries and Affiliates&rdquo;). Sometimes, these companies will be providing the Services
                to you on behalf of Fweez itself. You acknowledge and agree that Subsidiaries and Affiliates will be
                entitled to provide the Services to you.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.2 Fweez is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience
                for its users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Services which Fweez provides
                may change from time to time without prior notice to you.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.3 As part of this continuing innovation, you acknowledge and agree that Fweez may
                stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or
                to users generally at Fweez&rsquo;s sole discretion, without prior notice to you. You may stop using the
                Services at any time. You do not need to specifically inform Fweez when you stop using the
                Services.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.4 You acknowledge and agree that if Fweez disables access to your account, you may
                be prevented from accessing the Services, your account details or any files or other content which is
                contained in your account.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.5 You acknowledge and agree that while Fweez may not currently have set a fixed
                upper limit on the number of transmissions you may send or receive through the Services or on the amount
                of storage space used for the provision of any Service, such fixed upper limits may be set by Fweez at
                any time, at Fweez&rsquo;s discretion.<br />
                <br />
                5. Use of the Services by you<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.1 In order to access certain Services, you may be required to provide information
                about yourself (such as identification or contact details) as part of the registration process for the
                Service, or as part of your continued use of the Services. You agree that any registration information
                you give to Fweez will always be accurate, correct and up to date.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.2 You agree to use the Services only for purposes that are permitted by (a) the
                Terms and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the
                relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the
                United States or other relevant countries).<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.3 You agree not to access (or attempt to access) any of the Services by any means
                other than through the interface that is provided by Fweez, unless you have been specifically allowed to
                do so in a separate agreement with Fweez. You specifically agree not to access (or attempt to access)
                any of the Services through any automated means (including use of scripts or web crawlers) and shall
                ensure that you comply with the instructions set out in any robots.txt file present on the
                Services.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity that interferes with or
                disrupts the Services (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Services).<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.5 Unless you have been specifically permitted to do so in a separate agreement with
                Fweez, you agree that you will not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, trade or resell the Services for
                any purpose.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Fweez has no
                responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the Terms and for
                the consequences (including any loss or damage which Fweez may suffer) of any such breach.<br />
                <br />
                6. Your passwords and account security<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.1 You agree and understand that you are responsible for maintaining the
                confidentiality of passwords associated with any account you use to access the Services.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.2 Accordingly, you agree that you will be solely responsible to Fweez for all
                activities that occur under your account.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.3 If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account,
                you agree to notify Fweez immediately.<br />
                <br />
                7. Privacy and your personal information<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.1 For information about Fweez&rsquo;s data protection practices, please read
                Fweez&rsquo;s privacy policy. This policy explains how Fweez treats your personal information, and
                protects your privacy, when you use the Services.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.2 You agree to the use of your data in accordance with Fweez&rsquo;s privacy
                policies.<br />
                <br />
                8. Content in the Services<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.1 You understand that all information (such as data files, written text, computer
                software, music, audio files or other sounds, photographs, videos or other images) which you may have
                access to as part of, or through your use of, the Services are the sole responsibility of the person
                from which such content originated. All such information is referred to below as the
                &ldquo;Content&rdquo;.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.2 You should be aware that Content presented to you as part of the Services,
                including but not limited to advertisements in the Services and sponsored Content within the Services
                may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the sponsors or advertisers who
                provide that Content to Fweez (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify,
                rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this Content (either in whole or
                in part) unless you have been specifically told that you may do so by Fweez or by the owners of that
                Content, in a separate agreement.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.3 Fweez reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to pre-screen, review,
                flag, filter, modify, refuse or remove any or all Content from any Service.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.4 You understand that by using the Services you may be exposed to Content that you
                may find offensive, indecent or objectionable and that, in this respect, you use the Services at your
                own risk.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Fweez has no
                responsibility to you or to any third party for) any Content that you create, transmit or display while
                using the Services and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Fweez
                may suffer) by doing so.<br />
                <br />
                9. Proprietary rights<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.1 You acknowledge and agree that Fweez (or Fweez&rsquo;s licensors) own all legal
                right, title and interest in and to the Services, including any intellectual property rights which
                subsist in the Services (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world
                those rights may exist). You further acknowledge that the Services may contain information which is
                designated confidential by Fweez and that you shall not disclose such information without Fweez&rsquo;s
                prior written consent.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.2 Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with Fweez, nothing in the Terms
                gives you a right to use any of Fweez&rsquo;s trade names, trade marks, service marks, logos, domain
                names, and other distinctive brand features.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.3 If you have been given an explicit right to use any of these brand features in a
                separate written agreement with Fweez, then you agree that your use of such features shall be in
                compliance with that agreement, any applicable provisions of the Terms, and Fweez's brand feature use
                guidelines as updated from time to time.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.4 Other than the limited license set forth in Section 11, Fweez acknowledges and
                agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under these Terms in or
                to any Content that you submit, post, transmit or display on, or through, the Services, including any
                intellectual property rights which subsist in that Content (whether those rights happen to be registered
                or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing
                with Fweez, you agree that you are responsible for protecting and enforcing those rights and that Fweez
                has no obligation to do so on your behalf.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.5 You agree that you shall not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights
                notices (including copyright and trade mark notices) which may be affixed to or contained within the
                Services.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.6 Unless you have been expressly authorized to do so in writing by Fweez, you agree
                that in using the Services, you will not use any trade mark, service mark, trade name, logo of any
                company or organization in a way that is likely or intended to cause confusion about the owner or
                authorized user of such marks, names or logos.<br />
                <br />
                10. License from Fweez<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.1 Fweez gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and
                non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by Fweez as part of the Services as provided
                to you by Fweez (referred to as the &ldquo;Software&rdquo; below). This license is for the sole purpose
                of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Fweez, in the manner
                permitted by the Terms.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.2 You may not (and you may not permit anyone else to) copy, modify, create a
                derivative work of, reverse engineer, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract the source code of the
                Software or any part thereof, unless this is expressly permitted or required by law, or unless you have
                been specifically told that you may do so by Fweez, in writing.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.3 Unless Fweez has given you specific written permission to do so, you may not
                assign (or grant a sub-license of) your rights to use the Software, grant a security interest in or over
                your rights to use the Software, or otherwise transfer any part of your rights to use the
                Software.<br />
                <br />
                11. Content license from you<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.1 You retain copyright and any other rights you already hold in Content which you
                submit, post or display on or through, the Services. By submitting, posting or displaying the content
                you give Fweez a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to
                reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute any
                Content which you submit, post or display on or through, the Services. This license is for the sole
                purpose of enabling Fweez to display, distribute and promote the Services and may be revoked for certain
                Services as defined in the Additional Terms of those Services.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.2 You agree that this license includes a right for Fweez to make such Content
                available to other companies, organizations or individuals with whom Fweez has relationships for the
                provision of syndicated services, and to use such Content in connection with the provision of those
                services.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.3 You understand that Fweez, in performing the required technical steps to provide
                the Services to our users, may (a) transmit or distribute your Content over various public networks and
                in various media; and (b) make such changes to your Content as are necessary to conform and adapt that
                Content to the technical requirements of connecting networks, devices, services or media. You agree that
                this license shall permit Fweez to take these actions.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.4 You confirm and warrant to Fweez that you have all the rights, power and
                authority necessary to grant the above license.<br />
                <br />
                12. Software updates<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12.1 The Software which you use may automatically download and install updates from
                time to time from Fweez. These updates are designed to improve, enhance and further develop the Services
                and may take the form of bug fixes, enhanced functions, new software modules and completely new
                versions. You agree to receive such updates (and permit Fweez to deliver these to you) as part of your
                use of the Services.<br />

                13. Ending your relationship with Fweez<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13.1 The Terms will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Fweez as set
                out below.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13.2 If you want to terminate your legal agreement with Fweez, you may do so by (a)
                notifying Fweez at any time and (b) closing your accounts for all of the Services which you use, where
                Fweez has made this option available to you. Your notice should be sent, in writing, to Fweez&rsquo;s
                address which is set out at the beginning of these Terms.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13.3 Fweez may at any time, terminate its legal agreement with you if:<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (A) you have breached any provision of the Terms (or have
                acted in manner which clearly shows that you do not intend to, or are unable to comply with the
                provisions of the Terms); or<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (B) Fweez is required to do so by law (for example, where the
                provision of the Services to you is, or becomes, unlawful); or<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (C) the partner with whom Fweez offered the Services to you
                has terminated its relationship with Fweez or ceased to offer the Services to you; or<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (D) Fweez is transitioning to no longer providing the
                Services to users in the country in which you are resident or from which you use the service; or<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (E) the provision of the Services to you by Fweez is, in
                Fweez&rsquo;s opinion, no longer commercially viable.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13.4 Nothing in this Section shall affect Fweez&rsquo;s rights regarding provision of
                Services under Section 4 of the Terms.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13.5 When these Terms come to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
                liabilities that you and Fweez have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued over time
                whilst the Terms have been in force) or which are expressed to continue indefinitely, shall be
                unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 20.7 shall continue to apply to such
                rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.<br />
                <br />
                14. EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14.1 NOTHING IN THESE TERMS, INCLUDING SECTIONS 14 AND 15, SHALL EXCLUDE OR LIMIT
                Fweez&rsquo;S WARRANTY OR LIABILITY FOR LOSSES WHICH MAY NOT BE LAWFULLY EXCLUDED OR LIMITED BY
                APPLICABLE LAW. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OR THE
                LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF CONTRACT OR
                BREACH OF IMPLIED TERMS, OR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, ONLY THE LIMITATIONS WHICH
                ARE LAWFUL IN YOUR JURISDICTION WILL APPLY TO YOU AND OUR LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM
                EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.<br />

                REPRESENT OR WARRANT TO YOU THAT:<br />

                OF THE SERVICES WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE, AND<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (D) THAT DEFECTS IN THE OPERATION OR FUNCTIONALITY OF ANY
                SOFTWARE PROVIDED TO YOU AS PART OF THE SERVICES WILL BE CORRECTED.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14.4 ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SERVICES IS
                DONE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR
                COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OF ANY SUCH
                MATERIAL.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14.5 NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM Fweez OR
                THROUGH OR FROM THE SERVICES SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THE TERMS.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14.6 Fweez FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
                WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
                MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.<br />
                <br />

                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (I) ANY RELIANCE PLACED BY YOU ON THE

                <br />
                16. Copyright and trade mark policies<br />

                infringement that comply with applicable international intellectual property law (including, in the

                infringers.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16.2 Fweez operates a trade mark complaints procedure in respect of Fweez&rsquo;s
                advertising business.<br />
                <br />
                17. Advertisements<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17.1 Some of the Services are supported by advertising revenue and may display
                advertisements and promotions. These advertisements may be targeted to the content of information stored
                on the Services, queries made through the Services or other information.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17.2 The manner, mode and extent of advertising by Fweez on the Services are subject
                to change without specific notice to you.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17.3 In consideration for Fweez granting you access to and use of the Services, you
                agree that Fweez may place such advertising on the Services.<br />
                <br />
                18. Other content<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18.1 The Services may include hyperlinks to other web sites or content or resources.
                Fweez may have no control over any web sites or resources which are provided by companies or persons
                other than Fweez.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18.2 You acknowledge and agree that Fweez is not responsible for the availability of
                any such external sites or resources, and does not endorse any advertising, products or other materials
                on or available from such web sites or resources.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18.3 You acknowledge and agree that Fweez is not liable for any loss or damage which
                may be incurred by you as a result of the availability of those external sites or resources, or as a
                result of any reliance placed by you on the completeness, accuracy or existence of any advertising,
                products or other materials on, or available from, such web sites or resources.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18.4 You acknowledge and agree that Fweez is not liable for any unused credits.<br />
                <br />
                19. Changes to the Terms<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 19.1 Fweez may make changes to the Universal Terms or Additional Terms from time to
                time. When these changes are made, Fweez will make a new copy of the Universal Terms available at
                http://www.fweez.com/terms.php and any new Additional Terms will be made available to you from within,
                or through, the affected Services.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 19.2 You understand and agree that if you use the Services after the date on which
                the Universal Terms or Additional Terms have changed, Fweez will treat your use as acceptance of the
                updated Universal Terms or Additional Terms.<br />
                <br />
                20. General legal terms<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20.1 Sometimes when you use the Services, you may (as a result of, or through your
                use of the Services) use a service or download a piece of software, or purchase goods, which are
                provided by another person or company. Your use of these other services, software or goods may be
                subject to separate terms between you and the company or person concerned. If so, the Terms do not
                affect your legal relationship with these other companies or individuals.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20.2 The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Fweez and govern
                your use of the Services (but excluding any services which Fweez may provide to you under a separate
                written agreement), and completely replace any prior agreements between you and Fweez in relation to the
                Services.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20.3 You agree that Fweez may provide you with notices, including those regarding
                changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Services.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20.4 You agree that if Fweez does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy
                which is contained in the Terms (or which Fweez has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will
                not be taken to be a formal waiver of Fweez&rsquo;s rights and that those rights or remedies will still
                be available to Fweez.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20.5 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules
                that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms without
                affecting the rest of the Terms. The remaining provisions of the Terms will continue to be valid and
                enforceable.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20.6 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which
                Fweez is the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the Terms and that such other companies shall
                be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the Terms which confers a benefit on
                (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be third party
                beneficiaries to the Terms.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20.7 The Terms, and your relationship with Fweez under the Terms, shall be governed
                by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Fweez
                agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Lake Success,
                New York to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Fweez
                shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief)
                in any jurisdiction.<br />
